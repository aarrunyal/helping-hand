                    <p>Unfortunately, Ghana is a developing country and opportunities for a quality English education
                        are not provided to public school students. This leaves many children and teenagers without the
                        English language skills they need to truly thrive. Thus volunteers are badly needed to teach

                        <h2> Responsibilities &amp; Impact </h2>

                        <p>Volunteer English teachers in Ghana’s main focus is teaching English to local children in
                            primary, middle, or high schools. If you are skilled in teaching other topics such as math
                            or science then this may also be an option. Depending on your experience and skills, you
                            will either teach independently or work with a local teacher teaching classes ranging from
                            20 to 60 students. </p>

                        <p>You will also be arranging and leading various extracurricular and creative activities such
                            as games, sports, drawing, singing and dancing. For your classes, a curriculum and textbook
                            will be provided, but you are encouraged to bring storybooks or other teaching materials
                            that you believe will enhance the learning experience. </p>

                        <p>Although most people in Ghana speak English, there are significant challenges with
                            pronunciation and grammar. As English is a vital skill, schoolchildren in Ghana are eager to
                            learn, and love to have a native speaking teacher to teach them. The skills you impart will
                            be of critical importance for the children’s future, and you will be directly responsible
                            for giving them a better chance at a successful and thriving adult life. </p>

                    <h2> Volunteer Teaching in Ghana: Dates and Fees</h2>

                    <p>IFRE programs begin every Monday year-round. If you have travel constraints, you can still start your chosen program on any day of the year. </p>

                    <p><strong>Our Fees </strong> </p>

                    <p>Since 2006, IFRE has been the most trusted and respected volunteer abroad organization in the world, and also the most affordable. We’re dedicated to providing the highest quality volunteer programs at the lowest fees, which make it possible for everyone, especially students, to volunteer internationally and make a positive impact in the lives of others. </p>

                    <p>We believe in 100% transparency. Rest assured; we never use middlemen. Your one-time registration fee of $299 covers our administrative costs. The low weekly fee is paid in the host country directly to your host family and project (via country coordinator), and includes housing, food, and minor expenses. IFRE is a non-profit organization, so your program fees are tax deductible.  </p>
